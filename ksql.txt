Stream
A stream is an unbounded sequence of structured data (“facts”). For example, 
we could have a stream of financial transactions such as “Alice sent $100 to Bob, then Charlie sent $50 to Bob”. 
Facts in a stream are immutable, which means new facts can be inserted to a stream, but existing facts can never be updated or deleted.
Streams can be created from an Apache Kafka® topic or derived from an existing stream.
A stream’s underlying data is durably stored (persisted) within a Kafka topic on the Kafka brokers.

Table
A table is a view of a stream, or another table, and represents a collection of evolving facts.
For example, we could have a table that contains the latest financial information such as “Bob’s current account balance is $150”. 
It is the equivalent of a traditional database table but enriched by streaming semantics such as windowing.
Facts in a table are mutable, which means new facts can be inserted to the table, and existing facts can be updated or deleted. 
Tables can be created from a Kafka topic or derived from existing streams and tables. 
In both cases, a table’s underlying data is durably stored (persisted) within a Kafka topic on the Kafka brokers.
